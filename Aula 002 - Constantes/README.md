# Learnig about constants

## Concept

> we create a constant by transforming a variable by adding final before the variable declaration
> example:
> byte age=10;
> final byte AGE=10;
> after this change, it will no longer be allowed to change its value, either in the code or with user interaction

> ### Important
> the naming pattern of a constant is CAPS as it creates a visual highlight in the code
